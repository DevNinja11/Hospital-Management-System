# Hospital Management System

## Project Overview

This Hospital Management System (HMS) project address the traditional challenges faced in hospital management by transitioning from a paper-based to a digital solution. The existing manual systems often led to issues such as inefficient data management, time wastage in data storage and retrieval, and difficulties in understanding prescriptions. This project aims to streamline hospital operations by providing a comprehensive web-based application that enhances data accuracy, improves accessibility, and facilitates better management of patient records.

## My Contributions
As a full stack developer with a deep expertise in Java, I played a key role in developing the Hospital Management System (HMS). I focused on building and refining the back-end functionalities using Spring MVC and JDBC, which were crucial for managing patient and staff records digitally and streamlining prescription processes. My work ensured that the system was robust and user-friendly. Meanwhile, the front-end design, which involved HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, and the project management aspects using Maven, were expertly handled by my team members, allowing us to deliver a cohesive and efficient application.
